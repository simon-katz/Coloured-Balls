h1. Coloured Balls

This is a modified version of the code produced by Team 5 at the
early-May 2011 London Clojure Dojo.  I missed that dojo, and
picked up the code to have a play.  The changes I've made are
mostly trivial, and are mostly aimed at making things easier for me
to understand.  I would probably not defend many of the changes as
being improvements -- in most cases it's just that at my current
stage of learning Clojure the changes makes things easier for me to
read the code.

Bruce Durling asked me to post to the group to say what changes I'd
made, so here it is.

I've marked the changes I've made with "sk-change:" (without the
quotes), and included an explanation.
The only files changed are:
    readme.textile (this file)
    project.clj
    .../src/coloured_balls/core.clj

The Git tool for comparing old and new versions doesn't do a very
good job of matching up lines in the old and new versions of core.clj.
If you are really keen to see clearly what changes I have made and if
you have a side-by-side comparison tool that allows you to tell it
which lines match up, I'd recommend using that.
